# About this app

The HKR Schedule is a replacement for the current Kronox app (It sucks). It is compatible with any Kronox schedule, as long as you provide a website that obeys the following format: www.schema.[university].se.

  

# Current state

The app is not currently available in Google Play Store yet. It is currently on a limited private BETA that can only be accessed by me :). The app is useable, it serves a basic function of showing the schedule. However, I plan to atleast finish the settings system for a more complete package. 


I will probably roll out the first version as soon as its finish.

# Plans

- Finish the backend of the settings page

- Support for English and Swedish languages (As of recent, English and Swedish languages are supported but limited. The information of each class remains by default (Swedish). Therefore, an API is required)

- Need to find an alterative to Google Translate API because a single request takes atleast 3 seconds, and a traditional schedule has atleast 80 elements to be translated. Storing the translated text might solve the problem. 

- Store the schedule objects as a backup.
